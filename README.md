# Idle Daydreams

An interactive collage using three of [Felicia Chiao's](https://www.instagram.com/FeliciaChiao/) artworks.

## Inspiration

Chiao's artwork plays with lighting, perspective, and positive / negative space to create a cute but unsettling atmosphere. Aside from the more artistic details, she focuses on conveying her emotions, fears, and fragility through a fleshy, human-like being. Common motifs that appear are water, flowers, and a dark bean called The Fear—a representation of one’s anxiety that lingers in the corners. 

The first page draws inspiration from how Chiao illustrates flowers in her artwork. Although depicted with bright colors and smiley faces, the oversaturated flowers create a sense of false happiness, or a mask to hide what lies underneath. The focal point of this drawing is the fleshy being, who’s using a flower as an umbrella. It almost seems like it is not only using the makeshift umbrella to shield itself from the falling leaves but also from the rest of the world. 

The second page continues the flower motif to depict Chiao’s character in a field of daisies. HTML canvas is used to draw moving clouds, adding to the sunny skies. In the lower corner is a button; when pressed, the skies darken and The Fear (the small bean) come out of hiding. They serve as a representation of the anxieties that can suddenly appear in your mind.

The third page depicts the water motif that appears in Chiao’s works. In the caption of one of her posts, she talks about how she feels like she’s aimlessly floating through life with no sense of direction. To portray that feeling of having no control, different items float in water. A rotating CSS cube, with Chiao’s artwork drawn on its sides, sits in the center of the browser while other everyday objects drift next to it.
